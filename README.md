# CVE-2021-3449 PoC exploit

Usage: `go run -host hostname:port`

This program connects to a TLSv1.2 server.
After the initial handshake, it sends a maliciously-crafted `ClientHello`
per RFC 5746 that causes the server to crash.

The exploit code was injected into a bundled version of the Go 1.14.15 `encoding/tls` package.
